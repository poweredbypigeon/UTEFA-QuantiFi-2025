UTEFA QuantiFi - Contestant Template

This template provides the structure for implementing your trading strategy.
Your goal is to maximize portfolio value over 252 (range 0 to 251) trading days.

IMPORTANT:
- Implement your strategy in the update_portfolio() function
- You can store any data you need in the Context class
- Transaction fees apply to both buying and selling (0.5%)
- Do not modify the Market or Portfolio class structures
